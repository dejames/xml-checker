The Java program checks for repeated similar tags in an XML file. 
The program produces three output files : 
1. allSolutions.txt : with all solutions (repeated included)
2. uniqueSolutions.txt : with only the unique elements in XML.
3. duplicateSolutions.txt : with the repeated elements
 
HOW TO : 
1. Copy the XML content to resources/input.xml.
2. Set the variable ROOT_ELEMENT to the tag element which is supposed to be repeated.
3. Output shows total number of elements, number of unique elements and number of repeated elements. The files under resources directory will have the corresponding lists as well.
